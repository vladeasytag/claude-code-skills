# Safe gateway restart: kill only the python3 gateway process (not any shell whose
# command line merely mentions it), then relaunch via the flock launcher.
#
# Waits for in-flight Claude turns to finish BEFORE killing, because the gateway
# delivers a turn's reply only after its `claude -p` child exits — killing early
# orphans the turn and the reply is silently lost (happened 2026-07-08: /grammar
# removal confirmed 35s after the kill, reply never reached Telegram, and the next
# queued message died with the old process). Run me in the BACKGROUND from inside
# a gateway-spawned turn, or the wait below can only end at the 5-min cap.
#
# MUST be spawned DETACHED (setsid nohup ... &): a plain background job inherits
# the claude turn's process group and dies with it — happened 2026-07-10, the
# doc-reflex restart never ran and the gateway kept serving day-old code.
