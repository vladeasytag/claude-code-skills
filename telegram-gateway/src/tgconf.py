"""Config for the DST Telegram gateway.

The bot token lives in telegram/bot_token (chmod 600) or env TG_BOT_TOKEN — never
committed/backed up. The allowlist (telegram/allowlist.json) is the set of Telegram
user IDs permitted to talk to the bot; everyone else is ignored. This gateway can
read email, query the KB and run commands on Mercury, so access MUST stay locked.
